SQL Db2 for IBM i - on steroids

Db2 for i, has changed over the years to a different kind of animal. 
From a simple database that handles only tables, columns and 
rows to a complete ecosystem of structured and unstructured data and even procedural programming.
With the time given I will cover as much as I can of:
 

- Common Table Expressions
- Regular expressions
- Recursive SQL
- Compound statements
- Stored procedures 
- User defined Table Functions
- JSON
- XML
- Service consuming
- SQL Services
- SQL Triggers
- SQL performance
- Vector indexes
- Visual explain
- The system debugger
